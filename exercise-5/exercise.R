# Exercise 5: dplyr grouped operations

# Install the `nycflights13` package. Load (`library()`) the package.
# You'll also need to load `dplyr`
#install.packages("nycflights13")  # should be done already
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
View(flights)

# What was the average departure delay in each month?
# Save this as a data frame `dep_delay_by_month`
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarizing your data
dep_delay_by_month <- flights%>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(avg =mean(gain_in_air, na.rm = TRUE))
View(dep_delay_by_month)
# Which month had the greatest average departure delay?
highest_avg <- filter(dep_delay_by_month, avg==max(avg))
View(highest_avg)
# If your above data frame contains just two columns (e.g., "month", and "delay" in that order), you can create
# a scatterplot by passing that data frame to the 'plot()' function

plot(dep_delay_by_month)
# To which destinations were the average arrival delays the highest?
# Hint: you'll have to perform a grouping operation then summarize your data
# You can use the `head()` function to view just the first few rows


# You can look up these airports in the `airports` data frame!


# Which city was flown to with the highest average speed?
